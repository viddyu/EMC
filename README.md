# About the Theme

We as a group for the final class project wanted to develop an application that would be usefull and serve a purpose that has not allready been addressed.
An inspiration for us was the discussion with David about his role as a Paramedic.  Some of the methods of cummnications he discussed that were in use today reminded us of some of the means of communications utilized in an an old 1970's TV series ([Emergency!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency!)).   We decided therefore that the focus / theme of the project would be to develop, using modern web techniques, a prototype web-site illustrating how up to date communictions capabilities between the Ambulance and the Emergency Room can be facilitated.
